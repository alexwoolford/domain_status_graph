​


| ​",1.000,medium,incorrect,0.92,"The raw mention is the single word “Target,” appearing in a snippet that looks like a table heading (“Our framework for securing new capacity | … |”). In this context, “target” is far more likely to be a generic term meaning objective/goal/desired level (e.g., target capacity, target price, target date) or a column label in a framework table, not a reference to Target Corporation (the retail chain). There is no accompanying identifier such as “Target Corporation,” “Target Corp.,” “TGT,” or retail-related context (stores, merchandise, guest, etc.) that would anchor the mention to the public company. Additionally, the asserted relationship type (HAS_PARTNER) is unsupported by the snippet; nothing indicates a commercial partnership. From a business-logic standpoint, Hut 8 (energy infrastructure / bitcoin mining / HPC) having a partner relationship specifically with Target Corp. is implausible without strong contextual evidence.",A partner relationship between Hut 8’s energy/digital infrastructure business and Target Corp.’s mass retail operations would be unusual and would typically be explicitly described; the provided context does not support it.,"“Target” is being used as a common noun (a goal/benchmark) or a table column header (e.g., target capacity, target timeline), not as a company name."

The raw mention “Madison Square Garden Sports” is a direct shortened form of the legal name Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (ticker MSGS). There is little to no ambiguity because the mention includes the distinctive full brand name and the context even specifies the corporate suffix.,MSGE (entertainment venues/promotions) and MSGS (sports teams/related assets) are closely related MSG entities and it is plausible that MSGS would provide sponsorship sales representation services for MSGE assets via an agreement.

The surrounding text explicitly includes “Inc.” and frames it as a TPG-sponsored real estate product/vehicle, which aligns with TRTX being externally managed by an affiliate of TPG and commonly referenced by this name.

In this context, “Comstock” is far more likely to be the name of a generating facility/project or a geographic/location reference (e.g., a plant or project named Comstock) within CMS’s independent power portfolio, not a reference to Comstock Inc. (formerly Comstock Mining), a Nevada-based precious metals mining company.

Name-match quality is weak: “Comstock” is a common proper noun used for places and projects and is not uniquely identifying of the public company LODE. The filing context does not mention mining, Nevada, gold/silver, “Comstock Mining,” “Comstock Inc.,” or any corporate identifiers.

Business logic also conflicts with the asserted relationship type HAS_CUSTOMER: a list of independent power plants CMS owns is about assets/investments, not customers. Even if a c","Unlikely.

The context clarifies that the competitor is Vectron International, identified as a division of Knowles Corporation; Vectron is known in frequency control products that plausibly compete with LGL’s timing/frequency components. There is little risk of confusion with another similarly named entity because the mention includes the corporate form and is used as a parent company identifier.","LGL makes frequency/timing electronic components; Vectron (a Knowles division) operates in frequency control, making a competitor relationship plausible.

This clearly identifies the public company Celestica Inc. (NYSE/TSX: CLS) and matches its business description (design/manufacturing and supply chain solutions). However, the asserted relationship type HAS_SUPPLIER is not supported by the context; Celestica is referenced as an outside directorship of an individual, not as a supplier to Cohu. Therefore the specific entity-relationship match (Cohu has supplier Celestica) is incorrect even though the underlying entity identification is likely right.","A supplier relationship between Cohu (semiconductor test handlers/equipment) and Celestica (electronics manufacturing services) is not established in the provided text; the mention is about governance/board roles, not procurement or supply.","The mention most likely refers to Celestica Inc. as a company where the named individual serves as a director (an ‘other directorship’/affiliation), not a supplier relationship.

The context is a competitor list of “private and public HSC companies,” which fits Beam’s business as a gene-editing/base-editing biotechnology company with hematology programs that could compete in HSC-related therapies. There are no obvious alternative well-known entities with this exact name, and the inclusion of “Inc.” further indicates a specific corporate entity rather than a generic term.","Vor Bio operates in cell and genome engineering for hematologic malignancies and HSC-based approaches; Beam Therapeutics is a gene-editing biotech developing precision genetic medicines, including hematology/HSC-related applications.

There are no contextual cues suggesting a different ‘Caterpillar’ entity (e.g., a local firm or unrelated ‘Caterpillar’ product). In SEC filings, “Caterpillar” in an industrial/power-competitor context overwhelmingly refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries (Cat Power Systems).","Plausible and consistent: Polar Power operates in power systems for telecom and other applications; Caterpillar is a major competitor in generator/power equipment markets, commonly cited alongside Generac/Cummins/Kohler.

In this context, ""Apple"" most plausibly refers to Apple Inc. as operator of major digital music retail/streaming channels (iTunes Store, Apple Music), which are commonly cited alongside Amazon as online music retailers. While the music industry also contains entities like Apple Corps/Apple Records, those would not typically be referenced as an online retailer/distribution outlet in the same breath as amazon.com.

(PCC), a major producer of titanium and superalloy components/forgings. It is common in SEC filings to cite the parent company name rather than the operating subsidiary when describing competitors. Therefore the entity resolution to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

However, the provided surrounding context is a generic discussion of changes in the competitive landscape and technology, and does not show any explicit partner relationship, nor does it show that “Global Payments” appears in a competitor list or a contractual/relationship description. Additionally, “global payments” can be used as a generic phrase meaning worldwide payment activity; capitalization alone is not sufficient to disambiguate without more nearby text (e.g., listing other company names, ‘Inc.,’ or discussion of a specific agreement). Given the limited context and a questionable relationship type (HAS_PARTNER vs likely competitor/general industry reference), the match cannot be confirmed with high confidence.","Shift4 and Global Payments are in the same industry; mentioning Global Payments as a competitor would be logical, but describing it as a ‘partner’ is not supported by the provided context and is less likely.",The phrase could be a generic reference to global/international payments rather than the specific company Global Payments Inc.; or it could be referencing Global Payments as a competitor rather than a partner.

There is little risk of confusion with another entity because the mention is grouped with other major consumer social networks and is not used as a generic noun or acronym. Thus the entity match to PINTEREST, INC. (PINS) is appropriate.

One nuance: the surrounding sentence indicates Lulus uses these platforms for marketing/distribution, which is more a “platform/channel used” than a formal strategic partnership. However, that affects relationship typing more than entity resolution—the referenced entity is still Pinterest, Inc.’s service.","Plausible: an online women’s fashion retailer would market via social platforms including Pinterest, which is heavily used for fashion and lifestyle inspiration.

Note: while the entity match is correct, the stated relationship type (HAS_SUPPLIER) is somewhat strained—Apple is better characterized as a platform/distribution partner/gatekeeper (app store operator) rather than a traditional supplier—but this does not undermine the correctness of the company identity match.","IAC’s digital businesses plausibly depend on Apple’s iOS ecosystem/App Store for marketing/distribution/monetization, consistent with the disclosure about reliance on major platform operators.",Unlikely; other companies with ‘Apple’ in the name would not be described as operating a digital app store/social media platform.

In this construction, Visa and Mastercard are counterparties/network partners that provide the payment network rails and rules under which PNC processes transactions for merchants; they are not described as PNC’s customers. If anything, PNC is a participant/customer of the network, or Mastercard is a network partner/supplier, not a customer.",Banks commonly have agreements with payment networks (Visa/Mastercard) to enable card issuance/acquiring and transaction processing.

Given the lack of corroborating context and the questionable ""HAS_CUSTOMER"" relationship, the match cannot be confirmed with high confidence.","Healthcare Triangle is a healthcare IT/cloud/data services provider; Apple Inc. is a consumer electronics/services company. It is not impossible for Apple to be a customer (e.g., contracting for services), but it is not a typical/obvious customer relationship for this type of issuer.

Context supports this interpretation: the passage lists “Southern Power’s top three customers … Georgia Power, Florida Power & Light Company, and Duke Energy Corporation … of Southern Power’s total revenues.” Duke Energy is a large regulated U.S. electric utility and an active wholesale/bilateral power market participant, so it is plausible for it to be a significant customer of Southern Power (a generation/marketing affiliate of Southern Company).

One nuance: the customer relationship described is between Southern Power and Duke Energy, not necessarily directly between Georgia Power (the filing entity) and Duke Energy. But that affects relationship attribution, not the identity of the referenced entity.",Plausible: both are major U.S. electric utilities/energy companies; Duke Energy can purchase power under wholesale PPAs or market transactions.

In Dow’s 10‑K, Celanese could plausibly appear as a competitor, peer, customer, or in an industry list rather than a supplier. Without the actual sentence where “Celanese” appears, there is insufficient evidence to confirm both that the mention indeed refers to CE and that the asserted HAS_SUPPLIER relationship is correct.","Dow and Celanese are both chemical manufacturers; a supplier relationship is possible (e.g., specialty chemicals/inputs), but it is not the most typical or obvious relationship and would require clear textual support.

Thus, while the named entity aligns with the target company, the asserted relationship type (HAS_SUPPLIER: source mentions target as a supplier) is inconsistent with the business reality and context; Enact is not a supplier to Genworth but rather a controlled/related entity whose risks Genworth discusses.",Genworth Financial is the parent/controlling shareholder of Enact Holdings and discusses Enact as part of its business and risk factors. It would not typically classify its own subsidiary as a supplier.

In this context, it clearly refers to Oracle Corporation (ORCL), the well-known enterprise software/database company, not a generic term. The surrounding names (Adobe, AWS, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP) are all large technology vendors, reinforcing that this is the corporate entity.","IBM commonly forms strategic partnerships with other large enterprise software/cloud vendors for interoperability, joint solutions, and go-to-market alliances; a partnership with Oracle is plausible and consistent with industry practice.","Could theoretically refer to an unrelated company named Oracle, but given the peer list of global tech vendors, that is highly unlikely."

This directly matches the target public company Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) by name and corporate form, with no ambiguity from abbreviations or generic terms. The surrounding context is a competitive landscape statement, supporting a HAS_COMPETITOR relationship.","UTStarcom provides IP-based network solutions for telecom/cable operators; Cisco sells networking/telecom infrastructure and related solutions, so being competitors in a segment is commercially plausible.","Unlikely; there are no other prominent companies commonly referred to as ""Cisco Systems, Inc."" in this context."

There is no indication of the corporate entity (e.g., 'Crane Co.,' 'Crane Company,' products/segments) and the context is biographical/employment-related rather than a business partnership between HireQuest and a manufacturing conglomerate.","It is not logical that HireQuest would describe Crane Co. as a founder/managing partner of a small recruiting LLC; that role fits a person, not a corporation. Also the asserted relationship type HAS_PARTNER is unsupported by the text.","Likely a person named Crane (an executive or founder) associated with Touchpoint Search, LLC; could be an internal officer/director biography or a private individual, not the public company Crane Co."

There is no common alternative meaning for this phrase in biotech/10‑K contexts, and the surrounding list names other biopharma companies (Novartis, Bio-Path, Syros, Faron, ALX Oncology), supporting that each item is a peer company. Therefore the mention is very likely referring to the public company Shattuck Labs, Inc. (STTK).",Aptevo is describing competitors in developing non‑CD123 antibody therapies; Shattuck Labs is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology/biologics company and could reasonably be cited among competitors pursuing alternative antibody-based approaches in related hematology/oncology indications.

(ASIX), and in an LSB Industries 10‑K it could plausibly refer to that public company. However, the provided context places the mention under a “Competition” section: “We operate in a highly competitive market with many other larger chemical companies, such as …” This framing indicates AdvanSix is being cited as a competitor/peer chemical producer, not as a supplier to LSB. Therefore the resolved entity may be right, but the asserted relationship type (HAS_SUPPLIER) is not supported by the context.","LSB Industries (nitrogen/chemical products) competes with other chemical producers; listing AdvanSix among competitors makes business sense. Treating AdvanSix as LSB’s supplier does not fit the competitive-market sentence and would require explicit procurement/supply context (e.g., purchases of raw materials).","If the entity match is correct, the relationship should be COMPETITOR (or INDUSTRY_PEER), not HAS_SUPPLIER. If the match were wrong, it could theoretically be a generic/typoed reference, but the capitalization/spelling strongly suggests AdvanSix Inc."

The context is a revenue concentration table listing major customers, consistent with Impinj’s business of selling RFID endpoint ICs/modules to RFID label/inlay manufacturers and solution providers; Avery Dennison (including its RFID/inlay businesses such as Smartrac) is a plausible large customer. No abbreviation ambiguity or generic term issues are present.","Impinj supplies RFID ICs used in tags/labels; Avery Dennison is a major RFID label/inlay manufacturer and would reasonably be a significant customer, making the HAS_CUSTOMER relationship sensible.","Could potentially reflect a specific Avery Dennison subsidiary or business unit (e.g., Smartrac) rather than the parent entity, but the mention names the parent corporation explicitly, so the resolved match remains appropriate."
